# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
A client at Pewlett-Hackard would like us to apply data modeling, engineering, and analysis to assist him build an employee database with SQL that could potentially be used to query employees who are retiring for the next few years. <br/>
We built a database (See the Data folder) to store, maintain, and access the data that we used to query (See Queries folder), analyze, and create tables. <br/>
The database and analysis will help Pewlett-Hackard to generate a list of all employees eligible for the retirement packages, thus, serving to determine how many positions Pewlett-Hackard will need to fill.

## Results
We used SQL to query the database that we built, and created table to answer Pewlett-Hackard questions: <br/> 
* List of Employee eligible for retirement <br/>
  This table unearths the list of all employees who are potentially eligible for retirement regardless of whether they still with the company or not. Some of the employees were     mentioned several times depending on how many times they moved from one department to another within the company. We counted about distinct 90,000 employees eligible for           retirement.
